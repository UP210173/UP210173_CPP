This program includes various functions that they make use of, which are the following:

- ***setMarker()***, is the number of the square that will be occupied by the mark, to put it on the game board.

- ***ganador()***, to determine the winner of the game among the participants.

- ***tablero()***, the game board that will be drawn by the program, representing the game.

- ***juego()***, the game of the move that the users will make.

- ***swap_player_and_marker()***, swaps the player and the player after the game, to indicate and give the user his turn when it's time.
<br><br>

### **Game variables**
These variables that were used in the program were created, those that are global and those that are not, and are the following:

* ***current_marker***, is the mark or symbol to be placed and displayed on the board, depending on what the user has chosen and entered.

* ***juagdor***, to give the corresponding player a turn.

* ***jugador1***, one of the participants.

* ***juagdor2***, another of the participants.

* ***tablero***, the game board, defined as an array.

* ***row***, the rows that represent and divide the game board.

* ***col***, the columns that represent and divide the game board.

* ***i***, locate the marks on the board.

* ***marker_player***, is the game symbol on the board that identifies the player on it.
